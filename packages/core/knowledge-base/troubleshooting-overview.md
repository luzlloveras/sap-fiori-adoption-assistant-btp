# Troubleshooting Overview

## Start broad
Begin by confirming the user, client, and role assignment. Then check catalogs, spaces, and pages.

## Narrow down
If only specific apps are missing, focus on target mappings and authorizations for those apps.

## Escalation
If standard checks pass, request logs and authorization traces from basis or security teams.
