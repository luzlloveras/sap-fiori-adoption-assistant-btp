# Business Role and PFCG Assignment

## Role assignment basics
Users need the correct business role assignment. The business role typically references one or more PFCG roles that grant authorizations.

## Symptoms of missing roles
Users can authenticate but do not see any tiles, or they see a partial set of apps.

## Checks
- Confirm the business role is assigned to the user.
- Confirm the underlying PFCG role is generated and assigned.
- Ask for the exact user ID and role name used in the assignment.
