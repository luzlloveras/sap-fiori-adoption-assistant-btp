# Cache and Indexing Considerations

## Launchpad cache
Launchpad content can be cached. After role or catalog updates, users may need to log out and back in, or the cache must be refreshed.

## Content indexing
Some systems build indexes for tiles and target mappings. If indexing is stale, apps can appear missing.

## Checks
- Clear launchpad cache for the user or in the system.
- Rebuild content indexes if applicable.
- Test with a fresh user session.
