# Client, System Alias, and User Mismatch

## Why it matters
Access issues can stem from using the wrong client or system alias, or testing with a different user than expected.

## Checks
- Confirm the client number where the role assignment was done.
- Verify the system alias used in the target mapping.
- Ensure the user ID matches the one that received the role.
