# Roles, Catalogs, Spaces, and Pages

## How they relate
Business roles bundle catalogs, spaces, and pages. Catalogs define target mappings and tiles. Spaces and pages control what appears in the launchpad layout.

## Common visibility issue
If a user can log in but sees no apps, confirm the business role includes at least one catalog with visible tiles and that the assigned space/page is active.

## Typical checks
- Verify the business role contains the required catalog.
- Ensure the space and page are assigned to the same role.
- Confirm the catalog has target mappings for the intended apps.
