# Apps Not Visible Checklist

## Quick checklist
- User has the correct business role assigned.
- Business role includes the needed catalog.
- Space/page assignments are active.
- Target mappings exist for the apps.
- Cache has been cleared or session restarted.

## Outcome
If all checks pass and apps are still missing, collect logs and authorization traces.
