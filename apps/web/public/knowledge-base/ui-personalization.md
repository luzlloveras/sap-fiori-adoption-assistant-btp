# UI Personalization and Adaptation

## Personalization impact
Users can hide tiles or remove them from pages. Personalization can make apps appear missing.

## Checks
- Reset personalization for the user.
- Test with a fresh user to compare results.
- Confirm the space/page is not filtered by personalization.
